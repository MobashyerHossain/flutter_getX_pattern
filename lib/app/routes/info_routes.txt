# In this repository we will deposit our routes and pages.  
# We chose to separate into two files, and two classes, one being routes.dart, containing its constant routes and the other for routing.

- my_routes.dart
    # class Routes {
    # This file will contain your constants ex:  
    # class Routes { const HOME = '/ home'; }

- my_pages.dart
    # This file will contain your array routing ex :  
    # class AppPages { static final pages = [  
    #  GetPage(name: Routes.HOME, page:()=> HomePage()) 
    # ]};
