# Each module consists of a page, its respective GetXController and its dependencies or Bindings.
# We treat each screen as an independent module, as it has its only controller, and can also contain its dependencies.
# If you use reusable widgets in this, and only in this module, you can choose to add a folder for them.

- /example_module
    - example_page.dart
    - example_controller.dart
    - my_service.dart
    - example_binding.dart
    - /local_widgets

# The Binding class is a class that decouples dependency injection, while "binding" routes to the state manager and the dependency manager.
# This lets you know which screen is being displayed when a specific controller is used and knows where and how to dispose of it.
# In addition, the Binding class allows you to have SmartManager configuration control.
# You can configure how dependencies are to be organized and remove a route from the stack, or when the widget used for disposition, or none of them.
